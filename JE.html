        <h1>Surprises</h1>
        <p>I am probably the only UNC graduate student to present at APSA without applying. I was about a half-way through the email notifying me about my paper being accepted when I realized that it wasnâ€™t spam, John and Evi simply forgot to tell me that they submitted a paper on my behalf.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Notes </h1>
        <p>Took notes on every single comment that I received during CWG so I could focus on addressing questions. After that, we went over each and every comment and discussed how to move forward and improve the paper before sending it out.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Linguistic Assistance </h1>
        <p>Make sure I do not have any grammatical or spelling mistakes before submitting a paper to a conference/journal.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Methodological Accommodation </h1>
        <p>Adapt to methods that they are either unfamiliar with or even skeptical of if they believe that it would be in our best interest to use them.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Funding</h1>
        <p>John and Evi encouraged me to go to a workshop and apply for travel grant. While I received some funding, it was not enough to cover my expenses. They immediately offered to make up the difference.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Online Support</h1>
        <p>During fieldwork, I knew that John and Evi were always just a Zoom call away, whether it was to clarify doubts I was having or to share my enthusiasm about the evidence I gathered.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Offline Support</h1>
        <p>The most reassuring  thing I can do whenever I need to discuss a new research idea, if I feel like I am stuck in a rut, or even just being overwhelmed- is to go to their office hours and work through these issues.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Emotional Support</h1>
        <p>They can have the most precise and sweet words for any personal situation that I encounter; be it celebrating happy moments or making me feel like I am not alone in the bad ones.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>International Aid</h1>
        <p>Even before being her student, Evi offered me her help to navigate any bureaucratic situation that I faced while applying for the US Visa during the pandemic.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Gender Awareness </h1>
        <p>As a female student, Evi always tries to offset any kind of disadvantage that I may face, especially during conferences and entering academia networks.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Responsiveness</h1>
        <p>They are always on top of things. If you send an email to them, they will answer it quite quicky. Up to the point that they make me feel that I should respond to every email before 24 hours!</p><br><br>
