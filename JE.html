        <h1>Surprises</h1>
        <p>I am probably the only UNC graduate student to present at APSA without applying. I was about a half-way through the email notifying me about my paper being accepted when I realized that it wasn’t spam, John and Evi simply forgot to tell me that they submitted a paper on my behalf.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Linguistic Assistance </h1>
        <p>English is my second language and spelling software can only do so much. Before submitting any work to a conference or journal, John and Evi go over my draft to make sure I do not have any grammatical or spelling mistakes.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Being Protective</h1>
        <p>During a particularly difficult Q&A session after one of my first presentations, when I was struggling to answer some particularly aggressive questions, John stepped in to defend me and my work. Afterwards, he helped me parse through their comments to figure out what points were valid, and we worked out a way to address them. This is par for the course. John and Evi have always defended me when they felt someone was being unfair or harsh, and given constructive criticism afterwards, in private, if needed.<hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Gender Awareness </h1>
        <p>As a female student, Evi always tries to offset any kind of disadvantage that I may face, especially during conferences and entering academia networks.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Team Work</h1>
        <p>I was supposed to write the literature review and hypotheses section for a paper we were working on, but the review took me forever to complete. When I was done, John mentioned that he had finished writing the hypotheses section but made it sound like that was the plan all along.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Concern</h1>
        <p>When John and Evi realized that they hadn’t heard from me for nearly a month since the start of the pandemic, they reached out. They suggested we re-institute weekly check-in/catch-up meetings, which we hadn’t done since my first semester in grad school. They said they wanted to make sure I still felt connected to the department during a difficult time, and I feel like we have built a close personal relationship as well as professional.<hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>International Aid</h1>
        <p>Even before being her student, Evi offered me her help to navigate any bureaucratic situation that I faced while applying for the US Visa during the pandemic.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Job Market</h1>
        <p>I can directly trace the job I got post-graduation to opportunities John and Evi set up for me throughout my time in grad school. It’s too long to write out here, but the fact is a suggestion for a research stay at a partner institution in my second year of grad school ‘set in motion’ the events that would lead to my current position. I absolutely could not have gotten where I am without them. <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Funding</h1>
        <p>John and Evi encouraged me to go to a workshop and apply for travel grant. While I received some funding, it was not enough to cover my expenses. They immediately offered to make up the difference.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Notes 1</h1>
        <p>During my CWG, John and Evi took notes for every single comment I received so I could focus on addressing questions. After that, we went over each and every comment and discussed how to move forward and improve the paper before sending it out.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Notes 2</h1>
        <p>John invited me to my first conference overseas in my second year of grad school. He took me to every meeting with professors who wanted to meet with him and introduced me, making sure they knew who I was and what my research interests were. When I presented my poster, he sat next to me for the whole poster session, listening to me present and taking notes. Afterwards, we sat down and he gave me very thorough advice on my presentation style and how to address questions moving forward.<hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Methodological Accommodation </h1>
        <p>Jon and Evi adapt to methods that they are either unfamiliar with or are even skeptical of if they believe that it would be in our best interest to use them.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Networking 1</h1>
        <p>John and Evi have always made a point to set up meetings for me and their other graduate students with faculty from other universities that they felt it would be beneficial for us to know. When I was getting ready to do my field work, they reached out to their contacts to help me find home institutions and supervisors in the countries I’d be visiting.<hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Networking 2</h1>
        <p>John and Evi took me to a conference and I noticed them sometimes sitting in the back of random panels I was attending. They had organized a dinner with all of their former advisees who were there – and during that dinner I realized that they had gone through the program and had attended each of their presentations.<hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Online Support</h1>
        <p>During fieldwork, I knew that John and Evi were always just a Zoom call away, whether it was to clarify doubts I was having or to share my enthusiasm about the evidence I gathered.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Offline Support</h1>
        <p>The most reassuring  thing I can do whenever I need to discuss a new research idea, if I feel like I am stuck in a rut, or even just being overwhelmed- is to go to Evi's office hours and work through these issues.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Emotional Support</h1>
        <p>Evi can have the most precise and sweet words for any personal situation that I encounter; be it celebrating happy moments or making me feel like I am not alone in the bad ones.</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Responsiveness</h1>
        <p>They are always on top of things. If you send an email to them, they will answer it quite quicky. Up to the point that they make me feel that I should respond to every email before 24 hours!</p><br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Feedback</h1>
        <p>As others can attest, John and Evi have read every draft of everything I have ever written – including papers, proposals, grant applications, etc. – countless times. They always read everything thoroughly and take the time to sit down and make sure I understand all their feedback. I also felt that they made the transition through grad school seamless – they let me set the pace, gave me more freedom as time went on, and always prioritized my growth. They truly do exemplify mentorship. <hr>
